# NLP_emotions_detection

<b>This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect emotions in text. The goal is to build a model that can classify text into different emotion categories, such as joy, sadness, anger, and fear.</b>

In this project, I focused on the following steps:

<b>(a)Data Collection:</b>

Gathered a dataset of text samples labeled with emotions.

<b>(b)Data Preprocessing:</b>

--Text cleaning, including removal of stop words, punctuation, and special characters.<br>
--Tokenization and lemmatization of words.<br>
--Converting text into numerical representations by using pandas replace function.

<b>(c)Model Building:</b>

Implemented various machine learning and deep learning models, such as:<br>
i) Logistic Regression<br>
ii) Support Vector Machines (SVM)<br>
iii) Decision Tree<br>
iv) Random Forest<br>
v) Naive Bayes

<b>(d)Real-time Applications:</b>

a) Chatbots: Integrating the emotion detection model into chatbots for more empathetic and context-aware responses.<br>
b) Sentiment Analysis Tools: Creating tools for analyzing sentiments in social media or customer feedback.
