# NLP_emotions_detection

This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect emotions in text. The goal is to build a model that can classify text into different emotion categories, such as joy, sadness, anger, and fear.

In this project, I focused on the following steps:

In this project, I focused on the following steps:

<b>Data Collection:</b>

Gathered a dataset of text samples labeled with emotions.
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning, including removal of stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
Tokenization and lemmatization of words.
Converting text into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Building:

Implemented various machine learning and deep learning models, such as:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM):
