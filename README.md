# NLP_emotions_detection

<b>This project explores the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect emotions in text. The goal is to build a model that can classify text into different emotion categories, such as joy, sadness, anger, and fear.</b>

In this project, I focused on the following steps:

<b>Data Collection:</b>

Gathered a dataset of text samples labeled with emotions.

<b>Data Preprocessing:</b>

--Text cleaning, including removal of stop words, punctuation, and special characters.
--Tokenization and lemmatization of words.
--Converting text into numerical representations by using pandas replace function.

<b>Model Building:</b>

Implemented various machine learning and deep learning models, such as:
i) Logistic Regression
ii) Support Vector Machines (SVM)
iii) Decision Tree
iv) Random Forest
v) Naive Bayes

<b>Real-time Applications:<b>

a) Chatbots: Integrating the emotion detection model into chatbots for more empathetic and context-aware responses.
b) Sentiment Analysis Tools: Creating tools for analyzing sentiments in social media or customer feedback.
